Movie Recommendation System using AI Search & Q-Learning

This repository contains intelligent Movie Recommendation System using various Artificial Intelligence approaches. It makes use of **Graph Search Algorithms**, **Q-Learning**, and **Genetic Algorithm** to generate and score personalized movie recommendations.

##  Algorithms Used

### Search Algorithms:
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**
- **Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS)**
- **A\* Search**
- **Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)**

All search techniques find top movie recommendations by graph traversal between movie similarities and genres.

###  Q-Learning (Reinforcement Learning):
- **States**: Binary movie vectors (representing features)
- **Actions**: flip Bit to change features
- **Rewards**: Cosine similarity improvement
- **Training**: Over 1000 episodes with a trained Q-table
- **Output**: A sequence of recommended movies using learned policy

### Genetic Algorithms:
- Generate user preferences 
- Develop movie recommendations based on crossover and mutation
- Score users on similarity to user profile

## Files

- `movie_dataset.csv`, `cleaned_movie_dataset.csv`: Instead making vectors manually a dataset used to build vactors of films 
- `movie_vectors.json`: Binary vector for each movie
- `q_table_trained.json`: Q-values after learning optimal policy
- `random_users.json`: user preferences profiles
- `random_connections_graph.json`: Graph used in search algorithms

---

## Results (Q-Learning)

- Cosine similarity improved with iteration
- Most effective actions were stored in Q-table
- End policy can successfully recommend movies of the same genre
- Step-by-step explanation in `Qlearning.pdf`

## Visualization

All graph-based algorithm visualizations can be seen in your browser:

- `html_files/astar_movie_recommendation.html`
- `html_files/bfs_tree.html`
- `html_files/dfs_tree.html`
- `html_files/weighted_graph_visualization.html`

These show how each algorithm traverses the movie network to provide recommendations.
